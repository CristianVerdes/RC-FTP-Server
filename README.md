# RC-FTP-Server
This project is a FTP server that I did at Computer Networks class.
The server can:
- accept many clients (every client has it's own main directory)
- gives the client the feature to delete, create, copy directories and files. 
- download and upload files anywhere

## Running
- The project works only on a Linux OS.

## Problems
- The project has some threads sync problems (I'll fix this next week)
